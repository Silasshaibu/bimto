                <p>We are makers ourselves and realised there was no real platform for entrepreneurial, creative makers and artists.  We wanted to create a website where makers could sell their products to people who want to explore and buy things beyond traditional thinking, a wonderland of brilliant ideas.</p>
                <br><p>Let your audience know three things:</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Who you are </b><br>As makers ourselves we were frustrated with the mounting costs of selling our products through the larger commercial selling websites.  We thought it was time for someone to bring brilliant products to the market in a friendlier, more supportive way.  We are creative designers who value brilliant ideas and want to share them with as many people as possible.  Our fees are transparent and consistent so you know what the cost of selling will be upfront regardless of how many items you sell.</p>
                <p><b>What you do </b><br>We work with artists, inventors, designers and makers to bring their brilliant products to market.</p>
                <p><b>How they can buy from you </b><br>Paint a picture of what it&#39;s like to work with you
                    Starting with a simple low cost subscription paid by direct debit.  As it takes a while to set up the direct debit we will take all payment information upfront to set up the direct debit and then have a two week on-boarding period so we can assess their products and make sure they are a legitimate seller.  We will make personal contact via video conference to see them making the product, ask questions about sustainability, recycling, health & safety, postage and packaging.
                </p>

                <p> &nbsp; 1 – 10 products  <span> &ensp; &#163; 5.00 per week</span></p>
                <p>11 - 20 products <span>&ensp; &#163; 7.00 per week</p>
                <p>21 - 30 products <span>&#163; 10.00 per week</span></p>
                <p>31 - 40 products <span>&#163; 12.00 per week</span></p>

                <p>Free 14 day trial/assessment period.  You will be able to upload your photos, write the description and set your own prices.  This comes through to the seller support team to review before publishing.  You then communicate directly with your buyer and receive all the money paid (no additional fees).  If the customer has a query or complaint you will deal with it directly.  It is only if the buyer escalates the complaint, we get involved.  For any items above £20 you will have to have proof of delivery.  The seller is liable for ensuring their items are covered by insurance in the case of breakages or non-delivery.
